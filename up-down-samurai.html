                    <p> Up Down Samurai is a small rhythm game I made completely on my own. This game was made on my spare time, outside of school for an underclassman. I made this game while trying to iterate on the rhythm game genre and give it more of an action game feel. It was made in Unity.<br><br>

                    As it was for and underclassman, the game is in french. It might be a bit hard to grasp but it is still playable by anyone. Try it! </p>

                        <p><h3>Game Design & Gameplay</h3><br>

                        Up Down Samurai is the first rhythm game I made. As I've always loved the rhythm game genre, I wanted to have my own take on it. In order to make the game easy to pick up, I decided to give the player simple controls, different than the usual "key per note" approach rhythm games tend to have. The player only has <span class = "emph">3 inputs</span> to press in order to play: the <span class = "emph">Up</span> and <span class = "emph">Down arrow keys</span>, and the <span class = "emph">Spacebar</span>.<br><br>

                        The gameplay of this game is pretty simple. The player has to press the right key on the right beat. In order to know which key to press on the next beat, the samurai bounces up and down throughout the game.
