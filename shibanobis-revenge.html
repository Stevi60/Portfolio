                    In this project, I was fully in charge of the programming. Each one of us was also in charge of doing level design.

                        <p><h3>Code Architecture</h3><br>

                        Shibanobi's Revenge is the first game I made that had levels. In order to facilitate level creation in the engine, I created a seamless way for level screens to transition between each other. This way, the player doesn't have to think about camera control and can see everything he needs to see on a single screen.<br><br>

                        Every single level follows a pattern. Each screen is numbered and wrapped inside a <span class = "emph">box collider</span>. This way, the camera controller knows the boundaries of the current screen and knows which portion of the level it has to transition to next. </p>

                    <div class = "text">
                        <p> Shibanobi's Revenge is a game where the player has to perform precise movements in order to reach the end of each level. In order to help the player achieve this, <span class = "emph" >every movement ability is cancellable by another movement ability</span>. Therefore, I used a <span class = "emph">Finite State Machine</span> to make every state the player can be in, and give them the ability to switch between them when they need to. </p>

                        <p> <h3 class = "inline_title">Level Design</h3><br>
                        The level design was a very important portion of the game. It lets players learn the game's mechanics and apply them when the game challenges their skill. Every level was first <span class=  "emph">drawn on paper using a grid</span>. In order to have a seamless gameplay, we wrote down <span class = "emph">the distance of every ability</span> and used that information to make the obstacles. </p>
