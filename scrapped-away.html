                    <p> Scrapped Away is an action game where you play as a captive robot on a pirate ship. Your mission is to defeat its boos with the help of various weapons. This game was the project I carried out in a team of 7 for the final year of my Master's Degree at Nantes Ynov Campus. I was in charge of making all of the gameplay mechanics and all of the code's architecture.<br><br>

                    This game was made using Unreal Engine 5 and I made all of the code using Blueprints.</p>

                        In order to have a satisfying mechanics, the gameplay is fast and reactive. Having a satisfying gameplay implies having good game feel and a snappy input buffer. Therefore, I added <span class = "emph">Hit Stop</span>, <span class = "emph">Dashing</span> and a <span class = "emph">satisfying attack pattern</span> to make the game feel very good. </p>

                        <p><h3>Code Architecture</h3><br>
                        
                        The architecture of this game is based on the <span class="emph">design pattern of the observer</span>, the <span class="emph">design pattern of the singleton</span> and <span class="emph">Finite State Machines</span>. I made it like this because the game is rather simple and only involves actions surrounding the player character.<br><br>
                    
                        As the player uses a lot of weapons, I created a custom modular weapon class and enumerator whose behaviour don't need to be updated with if statements or additional code in the scripts, thanks to the design pattern of the observer.</p>
