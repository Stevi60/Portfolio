                        In order to grab the attention of players during game jams, our main focus is to create an interesting primary gameplay mechanic and create the game around it. The theme of the game jam was <span class = "emph">Delivery</span>. <br><br>
                        
                        I wanted to make a platformer with a twist so I suggested to have the player use a box to move around. The player has to keep the box from touching the ground below it, while throwing it around and catching it back to move effectively.</p>

                        <p><h3>Code Architecture</h3><br>
                        
                        As this game is a 2D platformer, the architecture is the same as every other 2D platformer I've worked on. It is based on <span class = "emph">Finite State Machines</span> and the <span class = "emph">design pattern of the observer</span>. This helped me make fluid transitions between the player states and let the players seamlessly do multiple actions when they want.<br><br>
                    
                        The design pattern of the observer lets me use update methods and if statements less frequently. Using this way of coding prevents me from using countless if statements and also prevents the code from breaking when some parts are missing or not used. </p>
