                    <p> Coupe & Touille is a small rhythm game about cooking a french meal: the Ratatouille. The player has to simply cut the vegetables in rhythm and get the highest score possible. This game is my first published title on the Google Play Store. I published it with the help of <a href = "http://kaisostudio.org" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: none; color: #4573eb;">Kaiso Studio</a>, a small design studio I created with a few friends.<br><br>
                    
                    Every part of the game was made by me: the game design, the gameplay, as well as the music!</p>

                        <p><h3>Code Architecture</h3><br>

                        As Coupe & Touille is a simple game, I was able to implement a simple architecture in order to practice my programming skills. I used <span class = "emph">the design pattern of the observer</span> as the main design pattern for the whole game. I found it very useful as rhythm games generally work around triggers and event calls following the beat of the music. Using this method, I can know when to send notes and how to animate the game on the beat</p>
